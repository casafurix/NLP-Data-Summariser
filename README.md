# NLP-Data-Summariser
An AI/ML based NLP solution that generates short summaries of press releases/news articles.

With the reducing attention span of the audience, citizens are increasingly looking for authentic information in the fastest possible manner. In this regard, an AI based solution needs to be developed which, on receiving a press release/article as input, provides short summaries and key highlights of a press release.

Text summarization is a very useful and important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  Suppose we have too many lines of text data in any form, such as from articles or magazines or on social media. We all have time scarcity so we only want a nutshell report of that text. We can summarize our text in a few lines by removing unimportant text and converting the same text into smaller semantic text form.
